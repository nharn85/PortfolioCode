        <h1>Project Details:</h1>
        <p>For the longest time I knew exactly what I wanted my logo to be. It was in my head, I just never had the time to create my brand. Thankfully, we were
        given an assignment in our design class to design our personal logos.</p>
        <p>After the logo was complete, it was time to move onto the business card. I focused on mimicking my website,
            adding personal touches, and leaving an impression. </p>

                    <p>As I'm not one to hand draw letters, I started on the search to find the perfect font to destroy in order to create this logo.</p>
                    <p>As you can see, I cut the font up, re-sized it, and meticulously deleted end points in Illustrator to get the exact look I wanted.
                    I was extremely happy with my end result.</p>
