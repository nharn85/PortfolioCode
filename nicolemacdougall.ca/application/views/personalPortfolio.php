        <h1>Project Details:</h1>
        <p>Would you trust a web developer without a website showcasing their skills?! I wouldn't either! And, as an up and coming web developer &amp; designer,
            I felt it was necessary to get myself out there...on the world wide web, or what have you.</p>

        <p>This re-design was inevitable. My previous site was developed using the basic knowledge I had at the time. There was no UX implemented, and the overall
            design was very poor. So, I took it in another direction. </p>

        <p>Starting in January 2015, I started sketching, and researching current trends for the year in web design. Single page layout, and responsive design were coming up
            everywhere. In addition to using these design elements, I added fun, quirky elements of my own to make things pop and catch your eye.
            You will also see in every footer is a link to my social media accounts, so that I can connect with my viewers on additional level.</p>

                        <p>My first wireframes for my new site were lacking my personality. The layout was a very standard multi-page website design.
                            Knowing I had to create something better to show off my abilities as a new web developer &amp; designer, I started researching
                            online for inspiration. After that, I was finally able to create a layout I was happy with.
